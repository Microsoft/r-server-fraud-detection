Fraud detection is typically handled as a binary classification problem, but the class population is unbalanced because instances of fraud are usually very rare compared to the overall volume of transactions. Moreover, when fraudulent transactions are discovered, the business typically takes measures to block the accounts from transacting to prevent further losses. Therefore, model performance is measured by using account-level metrics, which is discussed in the [For the Data Scientist](data-scientist.html) page.

For customers who prefer an on-premise solution, the implementation with SQL Server R Services is a great option that takes advantage of the powerful combination of SQL Server and the R language.  A Windows PowerShell script to invoke the SQL scripts that execute the end-to-end modeling process is provided for convenience.Â
